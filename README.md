# Original Rijndael Reference Implementations
This repository contains the original Rijndael reference implementation in C, as
well as the more optimised version written by Paulo Barreto.

Both implementations were released into the public domain by the authors. The
files were obtained from the Wayback machine's archive of
[the old Rijndael homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20070602160241/http://www.iaik.tu-graz.ac.at/research/krypto/AES/old/~rijmen/rijndael/).
